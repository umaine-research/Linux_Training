<img src="https://github.com/umaine-research/Linux_Training/blob/main/HPC_training_logos.png">

This repository contains information from a two-part introductory workshop on Linux command line basics and hands-on training using High-performance computing intended for all users, with no prior experience required. Focus on tools and tips needed to run pipelines and large data analysis (R, Python, Bash) on high performance computing environments.

Topics include:

- (1) Navigation using the command line
- (2) Common useful commands (e.g., ls, pwd, cd)
- (3) Connecting to HPC remote servers
- (4) Job submission using SLURM syntax
- (5) Using package managers (e.g., Docker, Anaconda)
